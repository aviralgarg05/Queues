# **Queue**
Queues are a common data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.


## **Explanation**

1. ### **Linear Queue**
    A linear queue is a basic implementation of a queue using a fixed-size array. The menu-driven code for a linear queue typically includes options to enqueue (add) elements, dequeue (remove) elements, display the queue, check if it is empty, check if it is full, and exit the program. The code must handle cases where the queue becomes full or empty.

 ## **Setup Instructions**

1. Install Python
2. Verify Python Installation

    ```bash
